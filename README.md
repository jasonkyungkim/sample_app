This simple application allows users to effortlessly remove backgrounds from images and applies a cool filter. It serves as a compilation of features developed for my side project, created specifically for demonstration purposes.

## Features

The currently selected date dynamically appears in a button on the main screen, and when opening the sheet, the date is auto-centered for convenience. A visual shadow effect highlights the selected date, enhancing user experience by visually linking the main view and the date picker.

When users select a tab, a matchedGeometryEffect smoothly highlights the active tab, while icons and text adjust in style based on selection. The retractable menu offers smooth expand/collapse animations, controlled by a toggle button with an animated chevron icon.
